## Welcome to my portfolio!

### A bit about me

I'm Brittney Ho, a senior at the George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, majoring in Journalism and Mass Communication with a minor in Communication.

I've spent the past four years studying the dynamic field of journalism in our nation's capital, which has given me a lot of real-world experience in research and reporting. Below, you'll find some of my projects from an advanced course, Reporting in the Digital Age, where we worked with real raw data to identify patterns and code original analyses. 

For some of my other original work, check out my [production portfolio](https://brittneyho.wixsite.com/portfolio)!


### Impeachment analysis

In October 2020, we looked at some raw data involving House Democrats' stances and behaviors regarding President Trump's impeachment. We used demographic information about their respective districts to try and find some patterns among the representatives.

### Biden Transition Analysis 

In the weeks following Joe Biden's 2020 election, announcements of new White House staff members and agency appointees dropped every day. We scraped data directly from Biden's [website](https://buildbackbetter.gov/nominees-and-appointees/) and used R to analyze some of those changes over time.

Take a look at those results [here](https://brittneyho.github.io/Biden%20Transition/).
