## Welcome to my portfolio!

### A bit about me

I'm Brittney Ho, a senior at the George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, majoring in Journalism and Mass Communication with a minor in Communication.

I've spent the past four years studying the dynamic field of journalism in our nation's capital, which has given me a lot of real-world experience in research and reporting. Below, you'll find some of my projects from an advanced course, Reporting in the Digital Age, where we worked with real raw data to identify patterns and code original analyses. 


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brittneyho/brittneyho.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
